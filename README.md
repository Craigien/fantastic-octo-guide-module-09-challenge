Module 09 Challenge

## Description

This web application allows the user to dynamically create a README file for a project.  It takes in user input for the various parameters of the README and generates the file with those inputs.  Items such as license badges and URLs are displayed dynamically based off of the user's selections and inputs.

## Installation

This application will require Node.js to use.  It will also require running "npm install" to pull in the inquirer library into your environment.

## Usage

To start the application, run the command "node index.js" in your terminal.  You will then be prompted for several inputs needed to generate your README file.  Complete all inputs and your README file will be generated in the output_README folder.
